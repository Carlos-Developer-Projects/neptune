# Neptune Chain Services
### No code Augmented Reality NFT Games

## Goal

Neptune Chain Services is a web app aimed at game designers and artists to allow them to make Augmented Reality TCGs, Collectibles, and other assets without having to code. The app will have a minter to make NFT assets, a dashboard to manage projects, a market to sell created items, and a game arena to play the games in Augemented Reality.
