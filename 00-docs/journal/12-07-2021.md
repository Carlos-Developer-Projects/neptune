# 12-07-2021 - The Dashboard Color Scheme

Today I decided on the color scheme of the overall project and implemented it onto the basic dashboard elements. The main colors will be #6f0000 and #200122. Although the logo is still a work in progress, a phase one version is also added to the dashboard.

## Dashboard Layout

I am trying to stay as organized as possible. This app is a pretty project to take on so I want to make all elements as resuable as possible and I have seperated my layouts since different parts of the app will have very different looks. The Dashboard layout is a simple three part layout with the sidebar on the left and a center region that includes a top bar.
